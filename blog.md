#### Incremental/Iterative Side Projects that are Fun

__What you will take away from this blog post:__
- How to have fun coding
- How to focus on small chunks of funtionality
- How to pick the right architechture for the job (limit scope)

__My goals for this project:__
- Learn how to manipulate SVGs
- Learn how to test front end components in React
- Sharpen HTML/CSS skills (no ui library components - grid OK)
- Responsive
- Make something beautiful

__How I am going to limit scope:__
- I don't need auth
- I don't need an api
- T don't need redux

#### Phase One:

Snap SVG, Vanilla Javascript, HTML CSS

main.js
index.html
main.css

set of functions that create and populate the DOM with SVG grid and shadow

#### Phase Two:

Add React with Components (no router, no redux)
Explore testing components
Make responsive

1. make a canvas component that will display svg


#### Phase Three:
