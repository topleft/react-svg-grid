#### Incremental/Iterative Side Projects that are Fun

__What you will take away from this:__
- How to have fun coding
- How to focus on small chunks of funtionality
- How to pick the right architechture for the job (limit scope)

__My goals for this project:__
- Learn how to manipulate SVGs
- Learn how to test front end components in React
- Sharpen HTML/CSS skills (no ui library components - grid OK)
- Responsive
- Make something beautiful

__How I am going to limit scope:__
- I don't need auth
- I don't need an api
- I don't need redux

#### Phase One:

Snap SVG, Vanilla Javascript, HTML CSS

main.js
index.html
main.css

set of functions that create and populate the DOM with SVG grid and shadow

#### Phase Two:

Add React with Components (no router, no redux)
Make responsive 
Explore testing components ~~ !!

1. make a canvas component that will display svg √
1. move inupts underneath canvas at 500px width √
1. set a min height and turn on scrolling when met

#### Phase Three:

Allow user input √
Animate Grid changes

1. user input √
2. lock down inputs to only allow valid entries (radius can't be negative)
3. create a draw button that draws the circle grid

#### Phase Four: 

1. create a drop down of different color schemes
1. make a random button that fills in all fields randomly
1. separate out values for rows and columns
1. ????

#### Beyond: 

1. handle new shapes - squares, triangles, ellipses
1. change perspective of shadow
